#### NOTE:
- This is not the fist calculator I have built. The previous app was a challange from [frontendmentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/home).
- It was built using vanilla javascript, all calculations where written by me. [link to my previous app](https://github.com/DainiusMI/Calculator-app)
- This time it is a React project, and for calculations I used and RESTful API [math.js](https://api.mathjs.org/).
